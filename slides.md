# Backstory

One of my first projects, I built and maintained a desktop application, I would build, ship and forget, I had no contact with customers and no need to diagnose their problems.


<!-- 
* Started building a cloud-enabled collaboration addition to the desktop client, suddenly, managed our deployed code, no longer commit and forget.
* On launch, after months of building, I get 5am call from CEO, users aren't getting their emails,

# So, what _is_ Observability‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ?

Characteristics of a system that allow us to understand it from the outside by asking questions without having to know its inner workings.

# Logging

* Text message added during development
* Lightweight
* Human Readable

Now, you have to build and re-deploy.

# The problems

---

# Metrics

* Aggregation removes plenty of data
* If you want more dimensions you have to instrument your code
* Tooling makes it very expensive to have dynamic graphs

<img src="/assets/graphs_many.png" style="max-with:50%" />

---

# Logs

* They're verbose and hard to parse
* Plain-text

<img src="/assets/the-birth-of-lincoln-logss-featured-photo.jpg" style="max-with:50%" />

<!-- 
* We added CorrelationIDs to logs to try and mitigate the issue, but tooling isn't in place
 -->

---

# Lack of context

We don't have a way to relate logs or metrics with the end user and across eachother

# Distributed architectures

![Message flow in microservices](/assets/microservices.gif)

::right::

* [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io) was started as an incubation project in the CNCF on Oct 2016, it defined a vendor-neutral API specification for sending telemetry.

* [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) provided a set of language-specific libraries for developers to instrument their systems and send it to their backends.

# Open Telemetry

> OTel‚Äôs goal is to provide a set of standardized vendor-agnostic SDKs, APIs, and¬†[tools](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector)¬†for ingesting, transforming, and sending data to an Observability back-end (i.e. open source or commercial vendor)[^1]

 # How

 Collect rich signals like _traces_, _metrics_, and _logs_.

 ## Traces

A trace is a representation of the path taken by a request as it propagates through a system


---
layout: section
---

# How does it look

Demo!

---

# Spans

* Represent a Unit of Work or an operation.
* Show the start and end times
* Operation name, events and links
* Any other metadata we want to include
* Established naming convention for standard components
  * db, net, http, etc.

---

# Spans

<table>
  <tr><th>Key</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  <tr><td>net.transtpor</td><td>IP.TCP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>net.peer.ip</td><td>10.224.0.1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>net.peer.port</td><td>443</td></tr>
  <tr><td>net.host.name</td><td>localhost</td></tr>
  <tr><td>http.method</td><td>PUT</td></tr>
  <tr><td>http.target</td><td>/reservation</td></tr>
</table>

---

# Span events

They represent a specific information point that happened during the execution of a span, think of them as log messages in relation to a span.


# Span Links
What about spans that are triggered asynchronously by a trace? Batch processes? Span Links let us relate spans and traces to others.

---

# How does this help us?


* Rich data allows dynamic visualizations and queries after the fact
* The richer the data, the more questions we'll be able to answer
* Start tackling the unknown-unknowns
