# Backstory

One of my first projects, I built and maintained a desktop application, I would build, ship and forget, I had no contact with customers and no need to diagnose their problems.


<!-- 
* Started building a cloud-enabled collaboration addition to the desktop client, suddenly, managed our deployed code, no longer commit and forget.
* On launch, after months of building, I get 5am call from CEO, users aren't getting their emails,

# So, what _is_ Observability‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ?

Observability is a characteristics of a system that allow us to understand it from the outside by asking questions without having to know its inner workings.

# Logging

* They record a text message that the developer deems could provide insights when researching an issue
* Lightweight
* Human Readable

# Lack of context

We don't have a way to relate logs or metrics with the end user

## Logs

* They're verbose and hard to parse
* Structured logs help add context
* If you didn't add a log then you won't be able to 

::right::

## Metrics

* Aggregation removes plenty of data
* If you want more dimensions you have to instrument your code
* Tooling makes it very expensive to have dynamic graphs

<!-- 
* We added CorrelationIDs to logs to try and mitigate the issue, but tooling isn't in place

# Distributed architectures

::right::

* [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io) was started as an incubation project in the CNCF on Oct 2016, it defined a vendor-neutral API specification for sending telemetry.

* [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) provided a set of language-specific libraries for developers to instrument their systems and send it to their backends.

# Open Telemetry

> OTel‚Äôs goal is to provide a set of standardized vendor-agnostic SDKs, APIs, and¬†[tools](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector)¬†for ingesting, transforming, and sending data to an Observability back-end (i.e. open source or commercial vendor)[^1]

 # How

 Collect rich signals like _traces_, _metrics_, and _logs_.
